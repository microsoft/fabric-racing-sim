## 🚦 Setup Instructions

### Quick setup summary

- Part 1 — Fabric: create a Fabric workspace, assign capacity, then upload & run the `Racing Sim Setup` notebook to generate `appsettings.json`.
- Part 2 — Telemetry Client: download the Forza Telemetry Client and replace its `appsettings.json` with the file exported from your Fabric workspace.
- Part 3 — Game: enable UDP telemetry in Forza, set the client IP and port (5300) and use the "Car Dash" packet format.
- Part 4 — Run: start the Telemetry Client and then start Forza; telemetry should stream to your Fabric workspace and dashboards.

### Part 1 - Set up Fabric

1. [Create a workspace in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/create-workspaces). For this project, do not use the default "My Workspace". Name the workspace `Racing Sim`.

2. [Assign a capacity to your workspace](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/workspace-license-mode). You can use a [trial capacity](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/fundamentals/fabric-trial).

3. Download the [Racing Sim Setup](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-racing-sim/blob/main/setup/Racing%20Sim%20Setup.ipynb) notebook from this repo.

4. [Upload this notebook](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-engineering/how-to-use-notebook#import-existing-notebooks) into the workspace you created in a previous step. Run all the steps in the notebook.

5. In your workspace home page, Browse to the notebook entitled *RacingSim Generate Config*.

6. In the Notebook Exlporer, select **Resources**. You will see a file entitled *appsettings.json* under the **Built-in** folder. Download this file to your device.

### Part 2 - Set up the Forza Telemetry Client

1. From the [Forza Telemetry Client repo](https://github.com/toolboc/forza-telemetry-client/?tab=readme-ov-file#usage), under the **Usage** section, select the link to download and extract the latest release. 

2. Open the extracted folder, and open the subfolder named *config*.

3. Replace the *appsettings.json* file with the contents of the *appsettings.json* file you downloaded from your Fabric workspace.

> For the Telemetry client to receive UDP data from network - if using another PC or an XBox - you may need to open UDP on Windows firewall. You can run this command in your terminal to open it
> `netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Forza Telemetry UDP 5300" dir=in action=allow protocol=UDP localport=5300`

### Part 3 - Configure your game settings

1. Open the Forza Motorsport game and navigate to the settings menu.

2. Go to **Gameplay & HUD**
3. Under UDP Race Telemetery, [configure the following settings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThrJOwOPMhI):

    | Name                   | Setting                                                                                    |
